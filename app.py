# WHAT THIS FILE DOES
# ============================================================
# This is my IBS Tracker app built with Streamlit.
# Streamlit reruns this entire file from top to bottom every
# time I interact with anything — click a button, tap a menu,
# move a slider. That's how it stays up to date without a loop.
# ============================================================


# ============================================================
# SECTION 1: GOOGLE SHEETS SETUP
# ============================================================
# These are the scopes — the permissions I ask Google for.
# I need both Sheets (to read/write my data) and Drive (to
# find my file by name). Without both, the connection fails.

# SECTION 2: SECURITY — INPUT SANITIZATION
# ============================================================
# I clean any text before sending it to the AI or saving it.
# re.sub() removes characters that could be used for prompt
# injection attacks — where someone types something sneaky
# into a text box to trick the AI into misbehaving.
# flags=re.UNICODE makes sure it works with all languages.

# so I don't need it to refresh the way my Sheets data does.

#      this section runs first and checks the Pending tab
#   4. If there's a pending meal, a banner appears at the top
#      asking how I felt, with a symptom field and pain slider
#   5. When I submit, the full entry saves to Symptoms and
#      the pending row gets deleted
#   6. If I dismiss it, the pending row is just deleted
#
# There's no push notification — the banner only shows when
# I open the app. But since it appears on every page every
# time, I won't miss it for long.

# I log food + time + water here. Symptoms and severity are
# NOT logged here — they come later via the post-meal banner
# once my stomach has had time to react (30–60 min).
# This two-step flow gives more accurate symptom data than
# logging everything at once right after eating.
#
# HOW FIELD CLEARING WORKS:
# Streamlit reruns the whole file on every interaction, so
# I can't just set a variable to "" and expect an input to
# clear — the widget ignores it and re-renders with its old
# value. The fix is to use session_state keys tied to each
# widget. When I want to clear, I delete the key before
